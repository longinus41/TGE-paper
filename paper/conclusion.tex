\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we have studied the deanonymization in Ethereum and similar DApp platform blockchains. An approach called I$^2$GL has been proposed to infer user identity using graph deep learning. Since the blockchain transaction graph is too large to be handled by traditional graph analytics methods, we use graph embedding technique to convert the original graph into a low-dimensional one. Furthermore, we exploit unique features of blockchain transaction graphs, such as time-density, second-order proximity, and asymmetric proximity, and correspondingly propose a series of enhancement. We evaluate I$^2$GL by comparing it with three state-of-the-art and experimental results on Ethereum transaction records show the superiority of I$^2$GL.
